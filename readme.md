# Create a Repository

In this activity we will create a Github repository and add group members as collaborators.

## Instructions

- One group member should create a new Github repository. Don't worry about the project name now, this can be changed later.
  -ALEXANDER CREATED MASTER
- From the repo's main page, click the "Settings" tab.

- Once in the repo's settings, select the "Manage access" menu item on the left.

- From the "Who has access" page, click "Invite a collaborator" and invite your group members to be project collaborators by entering their Github usernames one at a time.

- Each invited group member should receive an email they must open to accept the invitation.

### Hints

- Ask an instructor or TA if you get stuck!
